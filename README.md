# ISTE230-work
This repository is a portfolio for potential employers to access of all of the work I have completed for ISTE 230, Introduction to Database and Data Modeling. All of the assignments have been published AFTER their due date. 

All published code is published in an altered state. Portions of this code may be altered and/or deleted entirely to prevent from future cheating and/or misuse of the code. The problem statement/an altered assignment description will be provided for each assignment (each of which being published in its own directory)'s README file. 

Code written for exams will NOT be published in this repository. 

I, the code author and contributor of this repository, am the sole owner of all code published here (unless otherwise stated and created). All code published here is for PORTFOLIO USE ONLY. 
  I, the contributor, am not responsible for any misuse of published materials.
