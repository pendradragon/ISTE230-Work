# ISTE230-work
This repository is a portfolio for potential employers to access of all of the work I have completed for ISTE 230, Introduction to Database and Data Modeling. All of the assignments have been published AFTER their due date. 

Each assignment will be published in its own directory. Each directory will include a description of the assignment/problem statement in its README file. 

Code written for exams will NOT be published in this repository.
